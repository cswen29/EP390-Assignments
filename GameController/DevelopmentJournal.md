Game controller: Sony PS3 DualShock3


- Regarding the interactions that you created:
    - What kind of control is expected from interacting with each button and with the motion sensors?
        - Some buttons have to be held and some are like toggles on and off. Some are like midi keys so you press and it sustains as long as you keep it pressed.
        The Joysticks are set to delay effect and frequency shift. One of it has to be pressed to open a gate that accesses it cause the joystick can be a bit wonky at times. 


### What went well?
* The controls did what I assigned them to. 
* There are many fun ideas 
* using sel object as a strip note and or function object to have stuff sustain 
* It sounds pretty good. I love the effects I chose for this! 


### What did you try that didnâ€™t work?
* a lot of the issue I bumped into was actually more Max than the understanding of connecting the game controller into Max... 
* The tapin tapout delay isn't clean when I increase the knob so that wouldn't work, I will have to think of other ways
* I am trying to use PFFTs but not sure how the folder hierarchy work, I would like to add frequency shift or some type of modulation but personally I am not sure how to assign knobs to objects from beap etc, I understand the prepend stuff for FM8 plugins however, they do not give the exact effects I want. 
* Over-assigning can cause not having enough intuitive hand positioning!
